# edX CS50: Introduction to Computer Science - Final Project
I built a simple social website that is based on finding, reviewing and sharing movies. On this website, one can have their own profile, add movies to their watchlist, wishlist or favourites, write movie reviews and rate them, also find friends, see their reviews and wathed movies.

I have used a database of movies from IMDB.
